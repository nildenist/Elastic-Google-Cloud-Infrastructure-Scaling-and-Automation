**Cloud VPN** securely connects your on-premises network to your Google Cloud VPC network through an **IPsec VPN tunnel**.

Traffic traveling between the two networks is encrypted by **one VPN gateway**, then decrypted by **the other VPN gateway**.
This protects your data as it travels over the public internet, and thatâ€™s why Cloud VPN is useful for ***low-volume data*** connections.

As a <ins>managed service</ins>, Cloud VPN provides an SLA of 99.9% service availability and supports site-to-site VPN, static and dynamic routes, and IKEv1 and IKEv2 ciphers.
